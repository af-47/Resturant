1) WEBSITES
------------

* REACT BOOTSTRAP
* BOOTSWATCH

2) AJAX

* fetch
* asynch await

3) Redirection in React
------------------------

* react-router-dom
      - npm i react-router-dom

* import  { 
           BrowserRouter as router - all routing need components
          ,Routes                  - to set paths for each components
          ,Route                   - more than 1 path
          } from 'react-router-dom'

4) USEPARAMS
-------------

* Hook used to access params from component url.


5) coupling
------------

* Many connection between  parent and child.
* if A share data to B then to C. if B has error then C cannot get data . This error is called Prop drilling.

* ie..  in coupling , if any intermediate component have any error all other childs will not work.                                                                                               --------------
* to avoid this we use REDUX
                      -----

6) REDUX
----------

* to avoid prop drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all components independent.
* for this react introduced a new tech,
   - State Management Technology - REDUX. 

7) REDUX process
-----------------
* create a new js file to keep this states, all the components can access js file   
* But cant update datas in file.
  
 -ACTION - a file with all logics to update state.
 -DISPATCH - method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation.
 -REDUCER - update the datas in js file according to payload response get from action file.


8) REDUX libraries
------------------

1. REDUX
2. REACT REDUX
3. REDUX-THUNK

* createStore() - method used to create store in js file.
                - 2 arguments
                  
                  1. REDUCER
                  2. Middleware

                    MIDDLEWARE
                   ------------

   * for token verification , Manage API request

   * In REDUX we use Middleware to change Synchronous REDUX to Asynchronous REDUX
                  ----------
    (use change it to asynchronous because we want to use API calls which works only in asynchronous) 
                  


* applyMiddleware() - Method in REDUXto apply middleware.

* combineReducers() - Method in REDUX used to combine all reducers in JS 

* THUNK - Used to create middleware in REDUX-THUNK.



1. create store
2. apply store in index.js
   * provider - its a tag used to pass the store.(react-redux)
   

10) AXIOS - Module used to make http methods. (API call) 
----------

* npm i axios

useDispatch - hook used to dispatch actions in components - react-redux

useSelector - hook to access datas from store to components . 



11)TO START RESTAURENT APP
===========================


* cmd - code .
* cmd - npm start


*npx create-react-app appname ------to create react folder
